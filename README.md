# Super-Resolution GAN
Copy of deeplearning.ai (E. Zelikman) implementation of SRGAN (Ledig et al. 2017), with added code for taking in batches of images as inputs, super-resolving them, and visualizing them.

To execute, simply run
```bash
python srgan-inferencing.py {PATH TO IMAGES}
```
Two files, 'low_res.jpg' and 'high_res.jpg', will be saved to the repo.
